# My Hex Editor
Small hex editor for Windows Terminal that lets you view hexadecimal dump of a file, scroll through bytes in different pages with the arrow keys, and changes bytes and save to file.

I wanted to model how `xxd` does it but allowing you to move and edit like a TUI without using a TUI library because _idk_ lets do it with just the standard.

## TODO
- [x] Write feature TODO list
- [ ] Make linux version
- [ ] Scrolling 256 bytes at a time with CTRL+\<arrow key\>
- [ ] Color characters
